# 🐾 RADAR: Real-Time Animal Danger Alert Recognition

**RADAR** is a natural language processing project designed to detect urgent animal rescue signals from social media content. It uses machine learning to classify user-generated posts (e.g., tweets, captions) as potentially actionable alerts to aid animal protection and emergency response teams.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Build a binary text classification model to detect rescue-related content
- Explore urgency/sentiment tagging to help prioritize intervention
- Use minimal, accessible infrastructure for rapid deployment or prototyping

## 🛠️ Current Features
- Baseline text classification pipeline (TF-IDF + logistic regression)
- Jupyter notebook for model training & evaluation
- Sample dataset (to be refined)

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Fine-tune using transformer-based models (e.g., DistilBERT)
- Add sentiment/urgency detection module
- Explore real-time ingestion (e.g., Twitter API or mocked data stream)

## 💡 Inspiration
This project was developed as part of a personal pivot into machine learning for environmental and public good. It reflects an interest in combining data science with mission-driven problem-solving in climate resilience and animal protection.
