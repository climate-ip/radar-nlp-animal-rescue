# 🐾 RADAR: Real-Time Animal Displacement Alert & Response

**RADAR** is a natural language processing prototype designed to detect **urgent animal abuse and rescue signals** in digital content. Initially created to support animal protection efforts in South Korea, RADAR helps identify and surface online reports of cruelty, neglect, or emergency — transforming language into a tool for accountability and intervention.

---

## 💢 Why It Began

RADAR was born from a deeply personal and civic concern:

In South Korea, **animal abuse is not just online — it’s real, visible, and often horrifyingly public**. In tightly packed apartment buildings and neighborhoods, people frequently witness abuse firsthand: dogs being kicked, burned, tied, or starved — often by neighbors or family members. These acts aren’t just rumors; **they are recorded**, **photographed**, and **posted online** by bystanders trying to alert rescue groups and demand justice.

> RADAR started as a tool to support this decentralized vigilance — to **help identify posts reporting animal abuse**, classify their urgency, and surface them quickly for action.

While the system began with this focused goal, it has since evolved into a broader technical direction: **soft sensing for ecological distress**, using unstructured social signals to detect changes in environmental and animal wellbeing.

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Detect posts related to abuse, neglect, or urgent animal welfare concerns
- Classify urgency and relevance to support rapid intervention
- Use transparent, low-cost ML models that are easy to reproduce and audit

---

## 🛠️ What’s Working Now

- Binary text classifier (TF-IDF + logistic regression)
- Mock dataset of English-language animal rescue content
- Jupyter notebook for training, evaluation, and baseline benchmarking

## 🔭 Where It's Going

As RADAR grows, its ambition is expanding beyond abuse detection:

> RADAR is becoming a prototype for **social signal–based environmental sensing** — a system that listens to informal, community-generated language data to detect **wildlife displacement**, **urban ecological distress**, and **invisible climate impacts** that physical sensors miss.

Traditional tools like satellites and IoT sensors:
- Can’t detect localized animal suffering or displacement
- Often ignore data in non-English languages or low-infrared areas
- Miss emotional, human-centered signals embedded in language

RADAR listens to **what people say when something feels wrong** — especially in communities without formal monitoring systems.

---

## 🌍 Future Use Cases

- Urban wildlife conflict detection (e.g., animals migrating into cities)
- Ecological stress signals after natural disasters (floods, fires, heatwaves)
- Crowd-sourced, language-based environmental risk mapping
- Real-time triage tools for animal rescue and environmental NGOs

## 💡 Origin to Impact

This project began in direct response to **real-world cruelty** — witnessed, recorded, and shared by ordinary people trying to protect animals in their communities. But its future belongs to a larger system of environmental sensing — one where **language itself becomes a sensor**, and where everyday digital expressions can trigger faster, fairer, and more human-centered responses to crisis.
