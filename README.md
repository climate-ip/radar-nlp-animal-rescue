# 🐾 RADAR: Real-Time Animal Danger Alert Recognition

**RADAR** is a natural language processing project designed to detect urgent animal rescue signals from social media content. It uses machine learning to classify user-generated posts (e.g., tweets, captions) as potentially actionable alerts to aid animal protection and emergency response teams.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Build a binary text classification model to detect rescue-related content
- Explore urgency/sentiment tagging to help prioritize intervention
- Use minimal, accessible infrastructure for rapid deployment or prototyping

## 🛠️ Current Features
- Baseline text classification pipeline (TF-IDF + logistic regression)
- Jupyter notebook for model training & evaluation
- Sample dataset (to be refined)

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Fine-tune using transformer-based models (e.g., DistilBERT)
- Add sentiment/urgency detection module
- Explore real-time ingestion (e.g., Twitter API or mocked data stream)

## 💡 Inspiration
RADAR is rooted in a personal, long-standing concern for animal welfare. I've always cared deeply about nonhuman lives and the urgent situations so many animals face due to neglect, abandonment, or environmental hazards. This is not an abstract concern—animal abuse and neglect remain major problems in many parts of the world, including South Korea, where I’m from. While much of my work is driven by environmental resilience and justice, this project comes from a more personal place: a desire to use data and technology to help protect animals in real-time, however small the impact might be.
